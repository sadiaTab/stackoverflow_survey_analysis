# Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey Data Analysis

## Project Overview

Founded in 2008, Stack Overflow has evolved into a vital resource for developers worldwide, providing a platform for learning, knowledge sharing, collaboration, and career development. Every year, Stack Overflow conducts the largest global Developer Survey, collecting insights from over thousands of developers. This survey data, openly available, forms a valuable resource for in-depth data analysis, allowing us to explore real-world questions and challenges.

In this project, we focus on analyzing the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset. The 2022 survey gathered responses from over 70,000 developers, shedding light on how developers learn, the tools they use, and their preferences and demographics.

## Data Source

You can access the survey data in CSV format for each annual developer survey conducted since 2011 from the following link:

## Research Questions

In this data science project, we aim to address several research questions:

1. **What additional responsibilities do Data Scientists commonly take on in their current positions?**

   We'll explore the roles and responsibilities that Data Scientists often assume beyond their core tasks.

2. **Which programming languages are most frequently utilized by Data Scientists?**

   We'll identify the programming languages that Data Scientists rely on in their day-to-day work.

3. **Is there a correlation between holding a Doctorate degree and earning a higher salary?**

   We'll investigate whether having a Doctorate degree influences earning potential among developers.

4. **Which programming languages are in high demand among Data Scientists, both currently and for the future? Are there any languages gaining increased popularity?**

   We'll analyze the demand for programming languages in the field of Data Science, both in the present and future, to identify trends.

5. **Is there a gender-based salary disparity among developers, with male developers earning higher salaries than their female counterparts?**

   We'll examine whether there's a gender-based salary gap within the developer community, with a particular focus on Data Science roles.
